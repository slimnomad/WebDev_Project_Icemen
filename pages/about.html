                    <h3>Seasons at Ski Resorts</h3>
                        <p>Luca spent years on the slopes of Europe's best resorts. From Morgins to Zermatt, his days began with grooming runs and ended with late-night evenings planning the next expedition. He learned to read weather and snow like a book—skills that would later save lives. Between seasons he coached young athletes, organised avalanche-awareness workshops, and raced locally; those seasons shaped his instinct for risk versus reward.</p>
                        <p>Off the piste he collected small stories: late-night repairs in the workshop, cups of tea with mountain crews, and the rituals that keep communities together through long winters. Those experiences made him not only a better skier, but a better leader on the mountain.</p>

                    <h3>Trapped in the White Silence</h3>
                    <p>On a late-season descent, a sudden storm cut off routes back to the lodge. Snow rose fast and white silence closed around Luca and two companions. With low visibility and plummeting temperatures, he navigated by compass and memory, found a sheltered ledge, and kept them warm until a rescue team arrived hours later. That night taught him calm under pressure and the importance of preparation.</p>
                    <p>He rationed supplies, built an improvised windbreak, and kept morale by sharing stories and clear, methodical plans. The experience strengthened his belief in robust training, reliable gear, and quick decision-making—principles he now teaches others during clinic days and safety briefings.</p>

                    <h3>Helping People on the Slopes</h3>
                    <p>Over the years Luca became a trusted presence for injured and lost skiers. He learned first-aid, avalanche safety, and rope rescue techniques, and he volunteered regularly at local mountain rescue teams. His efforts have reunited families, guided lost hikers home, and trained new volunteers in safety procedures.</p>
                    <p>He also helped modernise local rescue protocols, introduced better communication routines, and advocated for clearer signage on routes. People remember Luca not only for the rescues but for the patience he shows when teaching a beginner to strap on skis for the first time.</p>
